  vs1003_hello
   
  A simple MP3 flow player to test if board and library are working together.
  The following sketch should say "Hello" every 0.5s :)

   06 Jun 2015 - Roger Clark, added support for SPI 2 and SPI 3
   29 May 2015 - Added a fix for booting the VS1053B boards into 
                 mp3 decoding instead of booting into MID (modeSwitch function).
